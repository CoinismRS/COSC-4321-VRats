# COSC-4321-VRats


A VR interior design application for users to plan room layouts that:
- scans the room via passthrough to generate a virtual blueprint of the walls, floor, and ceiling area via scene understanding.
- allows the user to scan for studs behind drywall and then mark that location in the VR headset.
- calculates the square area of each wall, then gives the user the option to calculate the amount of paint (of the user's choice) and the cost required to paint each wall.
- calculates the square area of the floor, gives the user the option to choose what type of flooring they want to use, then calculates the number of paneling/tiles/etc. needed and the cost to cover the floor.
- has added functionality to overlay decor on the walls so you can better visualize how something will look after it's hung up (i.e. allows the user to place objects such as sofas, lamps, carpets, etc. around the room to design the room as they want, which allows the user to plan ahead and get an idea of a finished layout for their room).
- (stretch goal) Allows multiple users to work on the same room layout at the same time and share objects across the play space. 

# Benefits:
- Eliminates the use of a stud finder and marking studs when trying to handle heavy objects
- ensures that heavy items are mounted into studs or drywall anchors are used in areas in between studs so that heavy objects are properly supported and don't come off the wall (i.e. - TVs, floating shelves)
- Does the heavy lifting of cost effective room layout setup. 
- Eliminates the risk of puncturing important wiring (i.e. - electrical internet cables)
- helps with feasibility analysis when remodeling if you know what's behind the drywall (i.e. - is there enough space if you're trying to hollow out the area to do recessed shelving; is the wall load bearing if you're trying to remove it)
- reduction in rework because you'll know exactly how something looks after mounting it
- better spatial awareness if you're hanging up multiple objects so that you can make changes if needed before hanging
