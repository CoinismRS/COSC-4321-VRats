(Optional) Cryptic Cabinet - mixed reality 
## Project Description

A VR interior design application for users to plan room layouts that:
- scans the room via passthrough to generate a virtual blueprint of the walls, floor, and ceiling area via scene understanding.
- calculates the square area of each wall, then gives the user the option to calculate the amount of paint (of the user's choice) and the cost required to paint all walls.
- calculates the square area of the floor, gives the user the option to choose what type of flooring they want to use, then calculates the number of paneling/tiles/etc. needed and the cost to cover the floor.

## Benefits:
- Does the heavy lifting of cost effective room layout setup. 
- helps with feasibility analysis when remodeling if you know what's behind the drywall (i.e. - are the studs spaced out enough to allow the user to handle certain heavy objects)
- reduction in rework because you'll know exactly how something looks after mounting it
- better spatial awareness if you're hanging up multiple objects so that you can make changes if needed before hanging
