# COSC-4321-VRats


A VR application that overlays housing schematics over walls so that you can see where your studs are behind the drywall

Benefits:
- Eliminates the use of a stud finder and marking studs when trying to handle heavy objects
- ensures that heavy items are mounted into studs or drywall anchors are used in areas in between studs so that heavy objects are properly supported and don't come off the wall (i.e. - TVs, floating shelves)
- Eliminates the risk of puncturing important wiring (i.e. - electrical internet cables)
- helps with feasibility analysis when remodeling if you know what's behind the drywall (i.e. - is there enough space if you're trying to hollow out the area to do recessed shelving; is the wall load bearing if you're trying to remove it)

- Added functionality could be the ability to overlay decor on the walls so you can better visualize how something will look after it's hung up

Benefits:
- reduction in rework because you'll know exactly how something looks after mounting it
- better spatial awareness if you're hanging up multiple objects so that you can make changes if needed before hanging
